Index of Consumer Sentiment
To calculate the Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), first compute the relative scores (the percent
giving favorable replies minus the percent giving unfavorable replies, plus 100) for each of the five
index questions (see x1...x5
 listed below). Round each relative score to the nearest whole number.
Using the formula shown below, sum the five relative scores, divide by the 1966 base period total
of 6.7558, and add 2.0 (a constant to correct for sample design changes from the 1950s).

Index Questions
The Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) is derived from the following five questions:

x1 = PAGO_R = "We are interested in how people are getting along financially these days. Would
you say that you (and your family living there) are better off or worse off financially
than you were a year ago?"


x2 = PEXP_R = "Now looking ahead--do you think that a year from now you (and your family living
there) will be better off financially, or worse off, or just about the same as now?"


x3 = BUS12_R = "Now turning to business conditions in the country as a whole--do you think that
during the next twelve months we'll have good times financially, or bad times, or
what?"

x4 = BUS5_R = "Looking ahead, which would you say is more likely--that in the country as a whole
we'll have continuous good times during the next five years or so, or that we will
have periods of widespread unemployment or depression, or what?"


x5 = DUR_R = "About the big things people buy for their homes--such as furniture, a refrigerator,
stove, television, and things like that. Generally speaking, do you think now is a
good or bad time for people to buy major household items?"
